            Since entering the pharmaceutical generics market in 2003 with ANDA approval for Cefuroxime Axetil Tablets, we have received over 300 FDA approvals and currently market more than 150 generics products in the U.S. We are the 3rd largest generic company in the U.S. by the number of unbranded and branded generic prescriptions filled. Our evolution into complex generics, particularly in inhalation and complex injectables, has been substantial, with these now making up 40% of our U.S. portfolio. We have over 100 products in the pipeline across a wide range of therapeutic areas and dosage forms, focusing on first-to-market launches of complex generics. A robust pipeline, strong customer relationships, and flawless execution drive our consistent track record of growth on the generic side.
