                Our R&D teams across the US, India and Europe are dedicated to developing a broad range of
                generic and complex generics products across the entire spectrum of routes of administration and
                dosage forms, with special attention to inhalation delivery and respiratory products. Additionally, our
                teams at Nanomi lead the way in developing controlled-release microspheres and nanoparticles,
                harnessing the power of proprietary Microsieve technology for advanced parenteral drug delivery.
